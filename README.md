The project involves creating predictive models to classify breast cancer cases as benign or malignant. The analysis includes:

Data Exploration: Understanding and preparing the dataset by reporting summary statistics and correlation matrix.
Model Building in Python:
k-NN Model: Implementing the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to predict cancer diagnoses.
Logistic Regression Model: Using Logistic Regression to classify cancer cases.
Model Evaluation in Python: Comparing the k-NN and Logistic Regression models based on confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best-performing model.
Model Building in RapidMiner: Replicating the k-NN and Logistic Regression models in RapidMiner and comparing their performance with the Python implementation.
The project aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of different classification techniques for predicting breast cancer diagnoses, helping in the early detection and treatment of the disease.
